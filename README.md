# Code Functionality
This script informed the analysis of syllabus data for the 2021 published reasearch paper on copyright pricing for higher education course materials.
The dataset is available at: https://datadryad.org/stash/landing/show?id=doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.pg4f4qrnj

Given a list of syllabi (.pdf, .html variants), this script incldues functions to parse them. 

For the purposes of the research, the script also clasifies them into 
a) one of three disciplines, 
b) the language of the syllabus, and 
c) whether there are required readings in them. 

Last, to assign our cohort of 18 student coders to validate the computer classification, the script assigns groups of coders to syllabi sets in a way that ensures equal representation.
